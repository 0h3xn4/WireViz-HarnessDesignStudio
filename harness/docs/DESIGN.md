# Design system of the editor

What the interface is made of: tokens, type and spacing, state badges, interface colours, shortcuts. The code is the source: `gui/tokens.py` (values), `gui/theme.py` (palette, style sheet, fonts), `gui/icons.py`, `gui/states.py`, `gui/tables.py`. A test (`tests/test_tokens.py`) checks contrast and colour-blind separation of the tokens; `tests/test_ux_foundation.py` checks the rest. One line per decision is kept at the end, newest last.

## Theme

- Three modes: **System** (default, follows the operating system's light/dark scheme while the program runs), **Light**, **Dark**. The choice is stored as `ui/theme` (`system`, `light` or `dark`). View > Theme.
- `ThemeManager.apply()` builds a `QPalette` and the style sheet from the tokens. No widget calls `setStyleSheet` and no code holds a `#RRGGBB` literal (the logo in `appicon.py` is the one brand exception); both are checked by a test. Widgets pick up rules by property: `primary`, `danger`, `muted`, `heading`, `align="left"`, `mono`, `iconOnly`.
- `theme.color(token)`, `theme.type(name)`, `theme.space(n)`, `theme.font(...)`, `theme.mono_font()`, `theme.control_height()`, `theme.icon_size()`; `current_theme()` for widgets built without a reference to the window's manager.

## Colour tokens

| Token | Use |
|---|---|
| `bg`, `surface`, `surface-2`, `border`, `text`, `text-muted` | Surfaces, lines and text |
| `primary`, `on-primary` | The one accent: the primary action and the selection |
| `focus` | Keyboard focus ring |
| `error`, `warning`, `success`, `info` | Severity and pass / fail |
| `pending`, `not-checked`, `stale` | A value or result that is not known yet, a rule that could not run, outputs older than the model |
| `locked`, `released` | Locked items, released harnesses |
| `auto-fill` | Auto-filled, not reviewed |
| `paper`, `pasteboard` | The drawing preview: the sheet (white in both themes, it is a picture of paper) and the table it lies on |
| `cat-*` | Interface categories on the canvas (below) |

Text tokens meet 4.5:1 on `bg`, `surface` and `surface-2` in both themes; borders, focus and category colours 3:1.

## Type and spacing

- Type scale in px: `sm` 12 (captions, canvas labels, table cells, status bar), `base` 13 (body), `md` 16, `lg` 20. IBM Plex Sans for the interface, IBM Plex Mono for pin, wire and part numbers, IDs, requirement IDs, hashes and paths (`mono` property, `theme.mono_font()`, `mono_item_font()` in models).
- Spacing in px: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32. Every control (button, combo box, line edit, spin box) is 32 px high at 100 % scale.
- Both are multiplied by the UI scale (100, 125, 150, 200 %).

## Icons

Lucide geometry (ISC licence, D-146) painted with `QPainter` from path strings; no SVG file at run time. `icons.icon(name, theme, role)` returns a `QIcon` that repaints in the theme's colours at any size, so a theme change needs no rebuild. Stroke width is 2/24 of the size, at least 1.5 px. Every icon button has an accessible name and a tooltip that names the shortcut: `icons.icon_button(button, name, theme, label, shortcut)`.

## State badges

One look for a state everywhere (table cell, card, header): icon, word and, for the two "nothing known yet" states, a pattern. Colour is never the only cue; a test renders the chips in grey and checks that they still differ.

| State | Icon | Word | Colour token | Border and fill |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pass | circle-check | Pass | `success` | solid |
| fail | circle-x | Fail | `error` | solid |
| warning | triangle-alert | Warning | `warning` | solid |
| info | info | Info | `info` | solid |
| pending | clock | Pending | `pending` | dotted border, dotted fill, italic |
| not-checked | circle-dashed | Not checked | `not-checked` | dashed border, hatched fill, italic |
| locked | lock | Locked | `locked` | solid |
| released | package-check | Released | `released` | solid |
| stale | refresh-cw | Out of date | `stale` | solid |
| draft | file-pen | Draft | `text-muted` | solid |
| in-review | eye | In review | `info` | solid |
| revised | rotate-ccw | Revised | `primary` | solid |

An empty cell shows nothing at all, so pending and not-checked can never be taken for empty, pass or fail. Selected rows draw the chip in `on-primary`.

## Interface colours (canvas)

Each category has its own colour, line weight and letter, so colour is not the only cue: Power (3.5 px, `P`), Data (2, `D`), Analog (1.5, `A`), RF (2.5, `R`), Pyro (4, `!`), Discrete (1.5, `d`), Ground (1, `G`); redundancy is a dashed line. Thermal links share Analog, other links share Ground. Values in `gui/tokens.py`.

## Tables

`DictTableModel` (rows as dicts or tuples, `Column` specs) + `TableProxy` (sort by number or natural text, filter by words, state or predicate) + `TableView` (header stays in view, cell selection, state chips, saved widths). Numbers are right-aligned with tabular figures, units are in the header ("Length (m)"), pin / wire / part numbers are monospace.

## Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z | Undo, redo |
| Ctrl+= , Ctrl+- , Ctrl+0 | Zoom in, zoom out, fit the diagram |
| Ctrl+K | Search and commands |
| Ctrl+Shift+I | Import interfaces |
| Ctrl+C in a table | Copy the selected cells as tab-separated text |
| Ctrl+Shift+C in a table | The same with the header row |

## Decisions

- Theme follows the OS by default, because an engineer's desktop already says light or dark; Light and Dark stay one click away. (SH-19)
- Fixed the type scale to 12 / 13 / 16 / 20 and the spacing to 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 as the standard says; the base text is 13 px (it was 14). (SH-22)
- One control height (32 px) set in the theme, with `min-height` and `max-height`, so a toolbar button, a push button and a combo box line up at every UI scale. (SH-23)
- Icons are drawn from Lucide path data with a small SVG path reader, not loaded as SVG, because the packaged program leaves out QtSvg. (SH-25)
- Monospace for anything an engineer reads character by character or compares (IDs, pins, hashes, paths). (SH-21)
- `pending` is teal and dotted, `not-checked` is slate and hatched, `stale` is orange; none of them is the green, red or amber of pass, fail and warning, and each has its own icon and word. (SH-28)
- Chip fill is a 4 % tint so text on it keeps AA contrast on all three surfaces; a test computes it. (SH-28)
- A new table starts in the order the rows are given; a click on a header sorts. (SC-21)

## Release, export, import and new project (ux/rel)

- The release dialog lists what the release locks as a tree under the sentence "This release locks: 18 wires, 198 pins, 9 interfaces, 3 parts, 1 interface type, 5 config files", because a person signing a release should see the objects, not only the counts. A config file that is still a placeholder is shown with the pending chip, and a frozen value that is not set reads "not set (pending)" in italics, never an empty cell. (SC-14)
- The new-revision dialog says what happens (the next revision becomes a draft, the released one stays as a baseline) and lists what becomes editable, counted only for objects that no other released harness also locks; those are listed as "stays locked". (SC-15)
- A disabled OK button always has a line under the form that says what is missing ("write at least 10 characters in the comment (3 more to go)"), and the same text is the button's tooltip. (SC-15)
- Releases tab: one timeline for all harnesses with a harness filter; the event (submitted for review, released, new revision) and the baseline are state chips (in review, released, revised), the harness state beside the filter is a chip too; the actions are buttons that emit signals and say why they are disabled in their tooltip. (SC-16)
- Differences are grouped by kind with counts in a list beside the table; added and removed objects say "(did not exist)" and "(removed)" in the empty cell, values use the report's wording ("(none)"). (SC-16)
- Export always writes the full set, because `write_outputs` deletes what is not in the new set and the independent check expects every harness. The tick marks of the harness by document tree choose what the result list shows and what "Copy selection to folder" copies; the manifest stays in the list and is never copied. (SC-12, SH-27)
- The output folder is shown read-only in monospace; an unsaved project, a read-only project and a damaged project are explained in a notice inside the dialog, with a "Save project" action for the first. (SC-12)
- A failed independent check or a write error is an inline notice with the first six problems that stays until the next export succeeds or it is dismissed; nothing is written and no pop-up opens. (SC-12)
- Reveal in folder opens the folder of the file with `QDesktopServices` (Linux file managers have no portable "select this file"); Open opens the file; the drawing picture is drawn from the project data with the sheet renderer of the drawing preview, since the packaged program has no QtSvg. (SC-12)
- Inline notices (`gui/notice.py`) carry an icon and a word for error, warning and note next to the colour, with the left bar the style sheet already used for banners. (SC-12)
- The import wizard uses the planner the command line uses for each kind, shows the same per-row reasons, and keeps the command line's rule that a list with a bad row is not imported at all (parts, lengths, ampacity table, netlist); only interfaces skip bad rows, as the existing dialog does. Option names of the command line in a planner message are put in the wizard's own words. (SC-17)
- Every import is one `ctl.run` step called "Import n rows"; what stays pending afterwards (parts whose approval is pending, the derating file that stays a placeholder, interfaces whose connectors are Auto, signals no interface uses) is listed on the third page with the pending chip. (SC-17)
- New project is one dialog (folder, name, example) with the error under the field it belongs to; the name follows the folder name until it is typed. (SH-18)

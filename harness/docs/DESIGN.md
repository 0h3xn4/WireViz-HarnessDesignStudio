# Design system of the editor

What the interface is made of: tokens, type and spacing, state badges, interface colours, shortcuts. The code is the source: `gui/tokens.py` (values), `gui/theme.py` (palette, style sheet, fonts), `gui/icons.py`, `gui/states.py`, `gui/tables.py`. A test (`tests/test_tokens.py`) checks contrast and colour-blind separation of the tokens; `tests/test_ux_foundation.py` checks the rest. One line per decision is kept at the end, newest last.

## Theme

- Three modes: **System** (default, follows the operating system's light/dark scheme while the program runs), **Light**, **Dark**. The choice is stored as `ui/theme` (`system`, `light` or `dark`). View > Theme.
- `ThemeManager.apply()` builds a `QPalette` and the style sheet from the tokens. No widget calls `setStyleSheet` and no code holds a `#RRGGBB` literal (the logo in `appicon.py` is the one brand exception); both are checked by a test. Widgets pick up rules by property: `primary`, `danger`, `muted`, `heading`, `align="left"`, `mono`, `iconOnly`.
- `theme.color(token)`, `theme.type(name)`, `theme.space(n)`, `theme.font(...)`, `theme.mono_font()`, `theme.control_height()`, `theme.icon_size()`; `current_theme()` for widgets built without a reference to the window's manager.

## Colour tokens

| Token | Use |
|---|---|
| `bg`, `surface`, `surface-2`, `border`, `text`, `text-muted` | Surfaces, lines and text |
| `primary`, `on-primary` | The one accent: the primary action and the selection |
| `focus` | Keyboard focus ring |
| `error`, `warning`, `success`, `info` | Severity and pass / fail |
| `pending`, `not-checked`, `stale` | A value or result that is not known yet, a rule that could not run, outputs older than the model |
| `locked`, `released` | Locked items, released harnesses |
| `auto-fill` | Auto-filled, not reviewed |
| `paper`, `pasteboard` | The drawing preview: the sheet (white in both themes, it is a picture of paper) and the table it lies on |
| `cat-*` | Interface categories on the canvas (below) |

Text tokens meet 4.5:1 on `bg`, `surface` and `surface-2` in both themes; borders, focus and category colours 3:1.

## Type and spacing

- Type scale in px: `sm` 12 (captions, canvas labels, table cells, status bar), `base` 13 (body), `md` 16, `lg` 20. IBM Plex Sans for the interface, IBM Plex Mono for pin, wire and part numbers, IDs, requirement IDs, hashes and paths (`mono` property, `theme.mono_font()`, `mono_item_font()` in models).
- Spacing in px: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32. Every control (button, combo box, line edit, spin box) is 32 px high at 100 % scale.
- Both are multiplied by the UI scale (100, 125, 150, 200 %).

## Icons

Lucide geometry (ISC licence, D-146) painted with `QPainter` from path strings; no SVG file at run time. `icons.icon(name, theme, role)` returns a `QIcon` that repaints in the theme's colours at any size, so a theme change needs no rebuild. Stroke width is 2/24 of the size, at least 1.5 px. Every icon button has an accessible name and a tooltip that names the shortcut: `icons.icon_button(button, name, theme, label, shortcut)`.

## State badges

One look for a state everywhere (table cell, card, header): icon, word and, for the two "nothing known yet" states, a pattern. Colour is never the only cue; a test renders the chips in grey and checks that they still differ.

| State | Icon | Word | Colour token | Border and fill |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pass | circle-check | Pass | `success` | solid |
| fail | circle-x | Fail | `error` | solid |
| warning | triangle-alert | Warning | `warning` | solid |
| info | info | Info | `info` | solid |
| pending | clock | Pending | `pending` | dotted border, dotted fill, italic |
| not-checked | circle-dashed | Not checked | `not-checked` | dashed border, hatched fill, italic |
| locked | lock | Locked | `locked` | solid |
| released | package-check | Released | `released` | solid |
| stale | refresh-cw | Out of date | `stale` | solid |
| draft | file-pen | Draft | `text-muted` | solid |
| in-review | eye | In review | `info` | solid |
| revised | rotate-ccw | Revised | `primary` | solid |

An empty cell shows nothing at all, so pending and not-checked can never be taken for empty, pass or fail. Selected rows draw the chip in `on-primary`.

## Interface colours (canvas)

Each category has its own colour, line weight and letter, so colour is not the only cue: Power (3.5 px, `P`), Data (2, `D`), Analog (1.5, `A`), RF (2.5, `R`), Pyro (4, `!`), Discrete (1.5, `d`), Ground (1, `G`); redundancy is a dashed line. Thermal links share Analog, other links share Ground. Values in `gui/tokens.py`.

## Tables

`DictTableModel` (rows as dicts or tuples, `Column` specs) + `TableProxy` (sort by number or natural text, filter by words, state or predicate) + `TableView` (header stays in view, cell selection, state chips, saved widths). Numbers are right-aligned with tabular figures, units are in the header ("Length (m)"), pin / wire / part numbers are monospace.

## Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z | Undo, redo |
| Ctrl+= , Ctrl+- , Ctrl+0 | Zoom in, zoom out, fit the diagram |
| Ctrl+K | Search and commands |
| Ctrl+Shift+I | Import interfaces |
| Ctrl+C in a table | Copy the selected cells as tab-separated text |
| Ctrl+Shift+C in a table | The same with the header row |

## Decisions

- Theme follows the OS by default, because an engineer's desktop already says light or dark; Light and Dark stay one click away. (SH-19)
- Fixed the type scale to 12 / 13 / 16 / 20 and the spacing to 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 as the standard says; the base text is 13 px (it was 14). (SH-22)
- One control height (32 px) set in the theme, with `min-height` and `max-height`, so a toolbar button, a push button and a combo box line up at every UI scale. (SH-23)
- Icons are drawn from Lucide path data with a small SVG path reader, not loaded as SVG, because the packaged program leaves out QtSvg. (SH-25)
- Monospace for anything an engineer reads character by character or compares (IDs, pins, hashes, paths). (SH-21)
- `pending` is teal and dotted, `not-checked` is slate and hatched, `stale` is orange; none of them is the green, red or amber of pass, fail and warning, and each has its own icon and word. (SH-28)
- Chip fill is a 4 % tint so text on it keeps AA contrast on all three surfaces; a test computes it. (SH-28)
- A new table starts in the order the rows are given; a click on a header sorts. (SC-21)

### Checks view (ux/checks: SC-1, SC-2, SC-3, SH-3, SH-17, SH-28)

- A result is one of pass, fail, not checked or pending, each a state chip (icon, word and pattern); a pass that read a placeholder file says "Pass (placeholder values)" so a pass never looks reviewed when it is not. (SC-1, SH-28)
- Results are grouped once per finished check from the findings the controller already holds (`ctl.drc_rule_results()`); while a check runs or is out of date the last finished list stays, and before the first one the table is empty with a sentence, never a list of passes. (SC-1)
- The summary strip counts "not checked" as not checked plus pending rules and "pending values" as the hand-over list `configcheck.missing`; each count is a button that filters the table. (SH-3)
- Rows sort worst first (fail, pending, not checked, pass); Tab leaves a table and the arrows move inside it; Enter on a rule moves to its details, Enter on an object shows it on the diagram. (SC-2)
- A value is supplied in a window of its own (not modal), validated while typing with the same planner that applies it, shown under the field and never in a message box; Apply is one undo step with a label. (SC-3)
- A running check says "checking" with Cancel; a failed check leaves a banner until the next success instead of a toast. (SH-17)
- Shortcuts: Ctrl+F filters the rules, Ctrl+Enter applies the engineering values, Enter shows the selected object.
